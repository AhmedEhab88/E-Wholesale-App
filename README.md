 # E-Wholesale-App 🛒👷‍♂️

This is a simple web application for a wholesale shop.
The idea of the wholesale shop is that it distributes goods from its inventory to registered retailers (or supermarkets) through its representatives.  

A web application will be available to an admin to manage the wholesale shop.  

A mobile application will be used by the representatives for placing orders.

## The process 🔃
A representative will visit a registered retailer, ask about what goods they need, and place an order for this retailer.   

Initially all payments will be cash-on-delivery, but a reciept can be printed upon placing an order.
